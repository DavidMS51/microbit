BBC microbit:bit stuff

Note the code on this side is provided for development purposes. 
It is functional rather that 'beautiful' and is offered for others to 
hack and develop rather than as a finished product.

The 'xxx.CPP' files are intended to be compiled using the mbed development
environment, while the .hex can be directly tranferred to your micro:bit.

The'xxx.py' are written in micro:python using the MU package
